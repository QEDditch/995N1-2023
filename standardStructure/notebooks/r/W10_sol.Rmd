In this notebook, we are going to look into classifying documents into diagnostics vs. non diagnostics using pubmed data from the cancerscreen project. 
 This is a larger and not pre-processed dataset compared to the one used in the lecture. Let's have a look at the dataset to see what's in our dataset.

```{r}
# 1. Explore data
rm(list=ls())
library(tidyverse)

setwd("__")
Medline <- readRDS("Diag_full.rds")
Medline <- as.tibble(Medline)
summary(Medline)
glimpse(Medline)
```

We have:
PMID : pubmed ids
T_A: title and abstract merged into one field
DP : publication year (it seems that it is only 2015)
Case: whether it is colorectal, lung or prostate cancer. 
diagnosis: whether the paper is about diagnosis or not
diag_type: a categorisation of diagnosis 

Let's give the data a first transformation from characters to categories to understand better the characteristics of our data

```{r}
# 2. select the relevant data
# select the type of classification to keep
Medline <- Medline %>%
  select(-diag_type, -case)%>%
  unique()

# Make sure the data is randomised
set.seed(200)
Medline <- Medline[sample(nrow(Medline)),]

Medline_diag <- Medline %>%
  filter(diagnosis =="Y")

Medline_nodiag <- Medline %>%
  filter(diagnosis =="N")

Medline_train <- bind_rows(Medline_diag[1:500,], Medline_nodiag[1:500,])
Medline_test <- bind_rows(Medline_diag[501:700,], Medline_nodiag[501:700,])
Medline <- bind_rows(Medline_train, Medline_test)

```

Let's clean part of the text:
```{r}
# 3. Normalize text for machine learning

library(tidytext)
library(tm)
library(SnowballC)
Stop_w<- c(stopwords("en"), "introduction", "conclusion","objective", "aim", "methods", "results", "conclusions","background", "percent", "may", "use", "used", "however", "p", "cancer", "study", "lung", "prostate","prostatic", "patient", "colorectal")
Medline$T_A <- removeNumbers(Medline$T_A)
Medline$T_A <- tolower(Medline$T_A)
Medline$T_A <-str_replace_all(Medline$T_A, "[^[:alnum:]]", " ")
Medline$T_A <- removeWords(Medline$T_A, Stop_w)

Medline$T_A <- gsub('\\b\\w{1,2}\\b', '', Medline$T_A) # remove words of two letters or under

```

Extract the tokens and compute tf-idf
```{r}
# 4. Get the word as features in columns



# reduce the size of the data to speed up the routine
Tidy_Med <- Medline [1:3000,]

# extract token and use stemming. 
Tidy_Med <- Tidy_Med %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, T_A) %>%
  mutate(word = wordStem(word, language="english")) 

# compute word counts
Tidy_Med <- Tidy_Med %>%
  count(PMID, word, sort=T) 

# compute tf_idf
Tidy_Med <- Tidy_Med %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, PMID, n)

# save the diagnostics features separately
diag <- Medline %>%
  select(PMID, diagnosis)%>%
  unique()

# Create a list of word to keep which are higher than a certain threshold
word <- Tidy_Med %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(n_doc = n())%>%
  filter(n_doc>39)

# only select the words over the threshold
Tidy_Med <- inner_join(Tidy_Med, word)%>%
  select(-n_doc)

#make words into columns/features
Tidy_Med <- Tidy_Med %>%
  select(-c(n, tf, idf))%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = word,
              values_from = tf_idf, 
              values_fill=list(tf_idf = 0))

# add back the diagnosis column
Tidy_Med <- inner_join(diag, Tidy_Med)
```

Normalise the column names, to make sure it does not create any errors when using mlr3
```{r}
# 5. Tidy up columns
Tidy_up <- Tidy_Med
names(Tidy_up)[3:ncol(Tidy_up)]<- as.character(seq(1, ncol(Tidy_up)-2, by=1))
colnames(Tidy_up) <- make.names(colnames(Tidy_up),unique = T)
Tidy_up$diagnosis <- as.factor(Tidy_up$diagnosis)
```

Set up the learner using mlr3
```{r}
# 6. Set up the learner
# install.packages("mlr3")
# install.packages("mlr3learners", dependencies = TRUE)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)

# set up the classifier task using the right data and target
task = TaskClassif$new(id="PMID", backend=Tidy_up, target="diagnosis")

# define the algorithm to be used
learner = lrn("classif.ranger")
learner$predict_type ="prob"

```

Train the model
```{r}
# 7. Train the model
# train a model of this learner for a subset of the task
learner$train(task, row_ids = 1:1000)
# this is what the decision tree looks like
learner$model
```

Test the model:
```{r}
# 8. Use the test set to see how the model is classifying the test data
predictions = learner$predict(task, row_ids = 1001:1400)

# look at the first 10 rows of the predictions
head(as.data.table(predictions), n=10)
```


Look at the accuracy score
```{r}
# 9. accuracy of our model on the test set
predictions$score(msr("classif.acc"))
```

```{r}
# 10. look at the confusion matrix
predictions$confusion
```


## Exercise 1: sample data ## (8 minutes)
Let's see if we can increase the current accuracy
What about if we increased the training data does that change the accuracy of the model?
Let's change in #7. and #8. to 
1. training 500, test 200
2. training 750, test 300
3. training 1000, test 400
4. training 1500, test 700

Which training size seems to give better accuracy?

## Let's add probabilities ##
At the end of #6. add the following line of code to check the confidence of the algorithm towards their prediction
learner$predict_type ="prob"

## Exercise 2: change the algorithm ## (8 minutes)
mlr3 comes with the learner 'classif.rpart'(#6.), but we can change the algorithm to other learners using the mlr3learners package (https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners)
Try the following algorithms instead in #6.
1. classif.svm
2. classif.glmnet
3. classif.ranger

Others are available, you can try others if you have time...

(if you get an error you may install a package as prompted... e.g. install.packages("ranger"))

## Exercise 3: Let's change the balance of the data to see if it affects the predicition ## (15 minutes)

In #2. let's see if an unbalanced vs. balanced dataset changes the accuracy of the model:

Create 2 datasets, Medline_diag and Medline_nodiag by separating the diagnostics vs non_diagnostics cases (using filter)

Then two datasets Medline_train and Medline_test with respectively: 
1. training --> nodiag: 700 diag: 300 | test --> nodiag: 200 diag: 200
2. training --> nodiag: 300 diag: 700 | test --> nodiag: 200 diag: 200
3. training --> nodiag: 500 diag: 500 | test --> nodiag: 200 diag: 200

To combine the training and the test set you can use the following code to help you:
Medline_train <- bind_rows(Medline_diag[1:700,], Medline_nodiag[1:300,])

when the training and test datasets have been done, don't forget to randomise the training dataset
(e.g. Medline_train <- Medline_train[sample(nrow(Medline_train)),])

And use bind_rows to join back the training and test set into Medline. 

Check how this affects the accuracy of the model.
