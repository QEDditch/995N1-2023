## Structure

Material is organised according to two different structures:
1. Traditional structure organised according to file type
2. Weekly structure based on Canvas weeks. Note that the guest lecture from Gavin Reddick is move-able depending on his availability and that W7 is deliberately empty owing to reading week. W11 is set aside for Q&A, for students to do their own thing, but has previously been used as the Gavin slot. Gavin's words about the real value of the module being that SPRU students know the how and the why rather than being the best data scientists is the key message to deliver throughout.

I have also included the material for the ODL Quantum Technologies Week 3

## Textbooks
Textbooks are free of charge and two are currently used:

R for data science 2nd edition - https://r4ds.hadley.nz/
Text mining with R - https://www.tidytextmining.com/ 
Python for data anlalysis 3rd edition - https://wesmckinney.com/book/ 

Dead tree copies are available for a price

For any future SQL training I haven't yet found a similar free textbook so the alternative is the w3 training at https://www.w3schools.com/sql/

## Opportunities for further development
Previous feedback has been to provide students with greater training on APIs and SQL. Python has already been included as of 2022 and updated for 2023. Daniele prefers to do R only work so his material which he has delivered in the past is R only for now. 

API additional training is relatively easy to do as the dimensions data work has been expanded in part. I would recommend going to OpenAlex APIs in the future as it's straightforward to do it in either R or Python and continues the recent requests for the module to be language agnostic.

SQL is much more challenging to organise from a logistics perspective without spending funds. Data is easy to get as OpenAlex has a guide on how to upload to BigQuery or other suitable database repositories for a price. But TEL and IT Services weren't helpful about helping or providing a free sql database so it may have to remain undone. I hope this situation changes in future. The original hope was to do SQL as the final workshop as a stretch goal.
